🧠 Embeddings Examples (Dense, Binary, Sparse)

This project demonstrates three major types of embeddings used in Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Dense Embeddings – semantic vectors from HuggingFace models

Binary Embeddings – binarized form of dense embeddings (0/1)

Sparse Embeddings – TF-IDF based keyword vectors

📌 Dense Embeddings

Dense embeddings are fixed-size continuous vectors (e.g., 384, 768, 1536 dimensions). They capture semantic meaning, so similar sentences are placed close to each other in the vector space.

Always fixed dimension regardless of input length.

Used in semantic search, clustering, and recommendations.

📌 Binary Embeddings

Binary embeddings are derived from dense embeddings by applying a threshold.

Values greater than the threshold → 1, otherwise → 0.

They reduce storage requirements and make similarity search faster (Hamming distance).

Useful when performance and efficiency are prioritized over precision.

📌 Sparse Embeddings

Sparse embeddings (like TF-IDF) represent text in a vocabulary-based vector space.

Vector length depends on vocabulary size.

Mostly 0s, with non-zero values for words present in the document.

Best suited for keyword-based retrieval and highly interpretable tasks.

Example: For the text “I love cats”, vocabulary might be ['and', 'animals', 'are', 'cats', 'dogs', 'love']. The sparse vector will have non-zero values only for "cats" and "love".

⚡ Comparison Type Dimension Size Values Use Case Dense Fixed (e.g., 384, 768) Continuous floats Semantic similarity, clustering Binary Same as dense 0 / 1 only Fast search, low storage Sparse Vocabulary size (varies) Mostly 0, few non-zero Keyword search, explainability 🚀 How to Run

Install dependencies: sentence-transformers, scikit-learn, numpy.

Choose the embedding type you want to test (dense, binary, sparse).

Run the script and observe the embeddings output and their differences.

👉 This project gives a side-by-side understanding of how embeddings can be represented in different forms and why each type is useful
